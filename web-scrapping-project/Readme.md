### A - What is Web Scrapping ?</br>
Is the automated process of extracting large amounts of data from websites. It involves retrieving unstructured data, typically in HTML format, and converting it into structured formats like spreadsheets, databases, or JSON files for further analysis or use. This technique is widely used in various industries for tasks such as price monitoring, market research, sentiment analysis, and more.

Web scraping typically consists of two main components:

1. Crawler: A program that navigates through web pages by following links to locate the desired data.

2. Scraper: A tool that extracts the required data from the HTML content of the web pages.</br>
### B - Applications of Web Scraping :

Web scraping has numerous applications across industries:

- <strong>Price Monitoring</strong>: Businesses use it to track competitor pricing and adjust their strategies accordingly.

- <strong>Market Research</strong>: Companies analyze consumer trends by collecting large volumes of data from various sources.

- <strong>News Aggregation</strong>: Scraping news websites helps compile stories from multiple sources for analysis or reporting.

- <strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong>: Social media scraping allows businesses to gauge public sentiment about their products or services.

- <strong>Email Marketing</strong>: Collecting email addresses from websites for targeted marketing campaigns

### C - Tools and Technologies :
Python is a popular language for web scraping due to its simplicity and powerful libraries like BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium. These tools enable developers to parse HTML, handle dynamic content, and automate browser interactions.
For example, BeautifulSoup is ideal for parsing static HTML, while Selenium is better suited for scraping JavaScript-heavy websites.
### D - How Web Scraping Works
The process begins by providing the scraper with URLs of the target websites. The scraper then loads the HTML content of these pages and extracts the specified data, such as text, images, or metadata. Advanced scrapers can also handle JavaScript-rendered content and extract data from dynamic websites.

In this project, we will use Python along with Selenium WebDriver to practice web scraping, with the main goal of understanding how web scraping works. To achieve this, we will implement our scraping tasks using both the Edge and Chrome browsers.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer :

This project is created strictly for educational and learning purposes only. The web scraping examples provided are intended to demonstrate how Python and Selenium WebDriver can be used to automate data extraction from websites.

- Users must ensure they comply with the Terms of Service of any website they scrape.

- Web scraping should only be performed on websites where it is legally permitted and does not violate copyright, data privacy, or intellectual property rights.

- The author of this project does not take responsibility for any misuse of the code or for scraping websites in ways that are illegal or unethical.

Always respect websites’ robots.txt files and use web scraping responsibly.
